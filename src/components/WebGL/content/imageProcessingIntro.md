# Image Processing in WebGL
At its core, image processing in WebGL treats images as textures - 2D arrays of pixels that we can manipulate through shaders. The basic workflow starts with loading an image into WebGL. This happens through a two-step process: first, we load the image in JavaScript, then we create a texture from it. A typical image load looks like this: const image = new Image(); image.src = 'input.jpg';
Once loaded, we create a WebGL texture to hold this image data. Creating a texture involves several steps, but the key operation is texImage2D(), which transfers the pixel data from our JavaScript image to the GPU memory. This is where our processing journey begins.
The real power of WebGL for image processing comes from fragment shaders. Think of a fragment shader as a program that runs on every pixel of your image simultaneously. This parallel processing capability makes WebGL extremely efficient for image operations. Each pixel in your output can read from any part of your input texture using the texture2D() function in GLSL.
Let's consider how basic color manipulation works. In a fragment shader, we can access the color of each pixel using texture sampling. The colors come as vec4 values (red, green, blue, alpha), each component ranging from 0 to 1. To adjust brightness, for instance, we might multiply these values: gl_FragColor = texture2D(uSampler, vTextureCoord) * 1.5;
Convolution operations form the foundation of many image processing effects. These operations work by sampling multiple nearby pixels and combining them with different weights. For a blur effect, we sample several surrounding pixels and average them. The larger the sampling area, the blurrier the result. The sampling is done using offset texture coordinates: texture2D(uSampler, vTextureCoord + offset)
Kernel-based operations extend this concept by using a matrix of weights. For example, edge detection uses a kernel that emphasizes differences between neighboring pixels. In the shader, we loop through the kernel positions, sample pixels, and combine them according to the kernel weights.
The concept of multiple render passes becomes important for more complex effects. Some operations require processing the image in multiple stages. For this, we use framebuffers - special buffers that we can render into instead of the screen. After one pass, the resulting texture becomes input for the next pass. We set this up using gl.framebufferTexture2D().
Resolution and coordinate spaces need careful handling in image processing. While WebGL uses normalized coordinates (-1 to 1), our texture coordinates use normalized UV space (0 to 1). Additionally, we often need to know the actual pixel dimensions of our image, which we pass to the shader as uniforms: uniform vec2 uImageResolution;
