        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="summary-text">
            The first version of WebGL was released in 2011 by the non-profit Khronos Group. Backed by industry giants like Apple, Google, Mozilla, etc. It was seen as an open platform to render graphics on the web without relying Adobe Flash or any specialized plugin. The idea behind making a JavaScript API for OpenGL was that there were already OpenGL developers who could capitalize on this API to make web-based graphics (an emerging platform at the time). The aim, a noble one, was to bring low level graphics rendering capabilities to the web. 
In 2017, Khronos Group released WebGL 2.0. It utilized the OpenGL ES 2.0 spec which brought higher fidelity features such as 3D textures to the web. 
WebGL standards are maintained and developed by the Khronos Group. Despite regular updates, WebGL seems to be on its way out now. Their effort seems to be primarily directed at WebGPU. While only a working draft currently, WebGPU is based on the Vulkan API- a much superior graphics rendering API in comparison to OpenGL.
