## Learning outcomes

Learning outcomes indicate what a learner should know by the end of the tutorial. They are often expressed using  
Bloom’s taxonomy and verbs. For example, “At the conclusion of this tutorial, the student should be able to  
compare and contrast the different types of web architectures”, or “the student will be able to write a single-page  
application using vanilla javascript”.  
Students who do your tutorial should come away with a basic idea of the history, the problem addressed, benefits  
and challenges, future potential/directions, and basic implementation skills

## Learning Activities

A step-by-step set of learning activities designed to help the “student” achieve the learning outcomes  
This is the scripted part of the tutorial where you lead the student through content and interactive activities. One  
thing your tutorial should do is present information in the context of what you learn in SER421 (meaning tied to the  
concepts covered in class). You may augment your tutorial with short video and audio snippets but these are not a  
substitute for have step-by-step textual instructions

## history 
A summary of the history of the technology, including references and discussion of any relevant standards  
**This does not have to be long**, but it should be complete – summarize the history and the adopted standards (and by what  
standards organization).


## Analytics 

An analytical component, where the team expresses an opinion, backed by evidence of the utility (present and future) of  
the technology.

### measure performance

- easy to learn
- performance 
	- mobile, computer - throttling and stuff
	- standard performance metric for rendering 
- tech-stack
- rendering methods
- Features



## Reference 

A reference list of the sources of evidence you used for the project. These include websites, readings, books, github  
repos, or anything else. References should be cited where they are used.  
A note on plagiarism – This is a form of cheating, meaning taking someone else’s work and calling it your own. Some  
important guidelines for this project:  
i) If you take something verbatim from somewhere, you must quote and cite it, and it must be in your reference list.  
ii) Your project demo is not a copy of someone else’s demo on the web. You must do the demo yourselves as a team.  
iii) The entire team is responsible for the entire project regarding plagiarism. If one team member plagiarizes the entire  
team gets a zero for the project.  
I do realize you will make heavy use of web resources to create a tutorial, this is fine, but if take something unattributed,  
and/or simply create your demo by using someone else’s demo, then this is cheating. I am looking for you to assimilate  
and integrate multiple sources, not just repackage them.

## Resource

Recommendations

A resource list – like a reference list, but more for additional learning resources that you may suggest to the learner for  
additional training.



---
	tutorial should be at least 3000 words not including code (for reference, this project handout is roughly 1500 words)

# DEMO

A demo of the technology. The demo for most project topics will be source code, though there are a few where the  
implementation may be scripts (terminal or within a tool). The demo should be a complete implementation that is of your own  
making. Demos that are clearly copies of something on the web with some slight modification will not be accepted and may be  
considered plagiarism. Demos should include source code and complete instructions for building and deploying the demo and on  
what target environments. As it is a demo of new/recent technology, you should indicate what prerequisites must be installed or  
available to deploy and execute your demo. The submission format for this is a GitHub repository that has the demo on the main  
branch by Wednesday December 11 at noon. It should include a clear Readme with instructions on installing and running  
anything required for the tutorial. The steps must be exact and complete, and tested on Windows 10/11 and Mac silicon and Intel  
unless there is a platform exception allowed beforehand by Dr. Gary

# Presentation

A presentation of the tutorial, analytical component, and demo of your product during the scheduled final exam period for this  
class. You will be required to turn in your presentation by the start of the final exam period. Your presentation should be 15  
minutes in length with 3-5 minutes for Q&A after
